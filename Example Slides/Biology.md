# The Kreb's Cycle

---

## Introduction

- Also known as the citric acid cycle or TCA cycle
- Named after Sir Hans Krebs who discovered it in 1937
- A series of chemical reactions that occur in the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells

## Steps of the Kreb's Cycle

1. Acetyl CoA Formation
- Pyruvate from glycolysis enters mitochondria
- Carbon is removed from pyruvate, releasing CO2
- Coenzyme A (CoA) attaches to the remaining molecule, forming Acetyl CoA

2. Citrate Synthesis
- Acetyl CoA combines with oxaloacetate, forming citrate
- Citrate is a 6-carbon molecule

3. Isomerization and Decarboxylation
- Citrate is converted to its isomer, isocitrate
- Isocitrate is then oxidized, releasing CO2 and producing NADH and alpha-ketoglutarate

4. Alpha-Ketoglutarate Oxidation
- Alpha-ketoglutarate is oxidized, releasing CO2 and producing NADH and succinyl CoA

5. Succinate Production
- Succinyl CoA is converted to succinate
- GDP is converted to GTP, which is a high-energy molecule

6. Fumarate Production
- Succinate is converted to fumarate, producing FADH2

7. Malate Formation
- Fumarate is converted to malate
- NAD+ is reduced to NADH

8. Oxaloacetate Regeneration
- Malate is oxidized, producing NADH and oxaloacetate
- Oxaloacetate can then combine with another acetyl CoA molecule to start the cycle again

## Summary

- The Kreb's cycle is a series of chemical reactions that occur in the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells
- It begins with the formation of Acetyl CoA, which combines with oxaloacetate to form citrate
- The cycle includes several steps that produce energy-rich molecules such as NADH, FADH2, and GTP
- The end result of the Kreb's cycle is the regeneration of oxaloacetate, which can combine with another acetyl CoA molecule to start the cycle again
- The Kreb's cycle is essential for the production of ATP, the main energy currency of cells.
